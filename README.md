# OpenSCAD-Tricopter
A fully customizable 3D printed tricopter designed thanks to [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org).
The tricopter works well but the documentation is a work in progress. If needed ask me ;-)

# Files
There is 4 categories
 * Helpers
  * Elements.scad => Contains all elements usefull for design (batteries, ESC, receiver, etc)
  * CCC3DBox.scad => A CC3D case I grabbed [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:95644). Not tested, I only used it for design
 * Assembly.scad => Assembly file, calculates required carbon rod length
 * Variables.scad => All parameters should be set here
 * And files with pieces to print
  * ArmHolders.scad

# Parts to buy
 * 3 Motors - 1806 about 2300 kv. I used DYS BE1806-2300kv
 * 3 ESC -  12A. I used [12A Afro ESC](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/%5F%5F62955%5F%5FAfro%5FESC%5F12Amp%5FBEC%5FUltraLite%5FMultirotor%5FESC%5FV3%5FSimonK%5FFirmware%5FUK%5FWarehouse%5F.html)
 * 5030 propellers. Whatever you find, clockwise and anti-clockwise
 * 1 servo motor, the [TGY-9025](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/%5F%5F31879%5F%5FTurnigy%5F8482%5FTGY%5F9025MG%5FMG%5FServo%5F1%5F8kg%5F0%5F09sec%5F11g%5FUK%5FWarehouse%5F.html) works fine and I design the support for it.
 * 10mm OD holow carbon fiber tube - about 35 cm. I used [this one](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/%5F%5F26195%5F%5FCarbon%5FFiber%5FTube%5Fhollow%5F10x750mm%5FUK%5FWarehouse%5F.html)
 * Batteries - 3S from 1.3Ah to 2.2Ah. [This battery](https://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/%5F%5F32111%5F%5FZIPPY%5FCompact%5F1300mAh%5F3S%5F25C%5FLipo%5FPack%5FUK%5FWarehouse%5F.html) is great, 2.2A works too but it is a bit heavy
 * 1 micro receiver. I use FrSky D4R-II 2.4G 4CH ACCST Telemetry flashed in 8 channels CPPM.
 * 1 flight controller. I used a cheap [CC3D](http://www.openpilot.org/products/openpilot-coptercontrol-platform)
 * 2 bearings - size 10x15x4 mm. Mine are 9.8 inner mm instead of 10, that is why I do not put carbon rod inside but designed a part.
 * Optionnal
  * Video for FPV
   * Holder for a [Sony 600 TVL](http://www.surveilzone.com/fpv/fpv-camera/sony-super-had-ccd-600tvl-fpv-ir-block-camera-2.8mm-lens)
   * Video transmitter
  * Bluetooth to ease configuration, especially if you but the USB port behind the servo like me (Not recommended :p)

Screew are all 3 mm, mainly 6 an 8 mm long (TBC). You can use metal screws but nylon will save weight, and especially act as fuses. It works well !

# Others
There are coments in code to help to understand, but from time to time some names are not explicits. If you change them PR are welcome !
Thank to the [Brocopter](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:413639) for some inspiration, especially to add some tape on the rods in order to adjust the motor support.
